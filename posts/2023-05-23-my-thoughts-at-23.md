**Note (30th December 2025):**
I started writing this in December of 2022, almost three years ago. I am posting it here to document it and because no one visits this website. I want to be more regular with what I write and with putting it out into the abyss starting now. This is the first step. No one cares about anything I do or say, but the act of publishing anything online has fascinated me for the longest time. I joined Watch Out! to fulfill this, and I do Physics for the same reason. I think a lot about my legacy. Filmmakers have their catalogues. With each film, the viewer can follow their journey. In the earliest films, you see ideas that repeat throughout their filmography. The same parallel can be drawn for musicians. Sadly, I am not creative and hence have to settle for building a body of work via Physics and maybe writing something worthwhile. When all is gone and everything is done I hope some of my work stays and lingers. Maybe some of it will also be useful.

> “वक़्त है, चला जायेगा।”

**Note:**
It should be evident that nothing I write can be helpful to anyone. There is no element of ‘gyaan’. I would have stopped reading if I were you and were not friends with myself. Quoting Surya’s memoir, “This is the last piece I will write for Watch Out! I figured in for a penny, in for a pound. Proceed at your own peril.”

The idea of writing this was born an (embarrassingly) long time ago. Mid-way, I realised the act of writing a memoir makes me write things I do not believe in, or worse, conceal things, an excrescence that I have sought to avoid.
I am at a critical juncture in my life, or so I believe. Such pitstops will be few; hence a good time to document my thoughts.
My inner monologue disrupts many of my thoughts and casts doubts over their ingenuity. I feel like I am teaching myself what I want to think. Writing this seems like an exercise in self-indulgence, which I try to avoid. This feels like a good time to give myself up on this indiscretion. I presume a lot of this is going to be proud and unnecessary. I hope to make sense and get across what I want to say.

## On Roorkee

> “ये शाम-ओ-सहर ये शम्स-ओ-क़मर ये अख़्तर-ओ-कौकब अपने हैं,
> ये लौह-ओ-क़लम ये तब्ल-ओ-अलम ये माल-ओ-हशम सब अपने हैं |

Much to my younger self's disdain, Roorkee is not nestled in the Himalayas' foothills. It does not have the calm of a city in the mountains, cities that I would like to settle in. It is a series of bustling streets peppered with a thousand shops catering to the needs of the students of a university masquerading as being great, still hungover the titles adorned to it by the British, much like its inhabitants drunk over the conquest of a high school examination. The hullabaloo dies out as one enters the famed walls, but not the hustle and bustle. It changes shape. Students scamper the roads and the halls of the lecture complexes with a whirlwind of emotions still inside them. Perennially looking for something they love, someone they adore. I entered Roorkee in the same stead. Confused, besotted and mostly sad. The pain of separation and dreams of a career in Physics. Roorkee happened, I wasn’t too proud, nor was I dejected. I would have loved to attend a better college, but I would also love to be India's Prime Minister. Pipe dreams don’t get you anywhere.

The rooms themselves are archaic, suited to the needs of a student arriving in the small town of Roorkee in 1970, not the tumultuous city of 2018. Dilapidated walls, rough floor, and the bed is just a plank of wood. The roof of my room leaked when it rained, and the wind, along with leaves, gushed through the broken window. Despite this, I always felt at home whenever I entered my room. No matter what happened, I could always find solace in it. The walls were always there. The bed remained as I left it. Single rooms are essential. It looks like they will soon be a thing of the past. The rate at which the students are increasing far outweighs the resources necessary for their upkeep. I hope this is fixed. I can’t imagine how college would have been without a room of my own.

I had a few friends I knew from my city, so I was not completely alone. Mostly, I have never cared enough to go out of my way to talk to people. A decision I sometimes regret, but I am better off as I am. Despite my reluctance, I forged a lot of friendships. This speaks more to how welcoming a new place can be and how nice people usually are.
Roorkee houses a lot of personalities, all of which are characters. In school, I always felt people were similar to each other, probably because teenage is an age of self-discovery. Everyone in Roorkee has their quirks. I am sure I have mine as well. This has been fascinating to see. Roorkee provides you with a community. None of my friends know me better than the people living in the select rooms of Govind. Having friends in your branch is imperative when you are in a five-year course. I can always put on a show and act my part for everyone else. I will possibly miss all of them when all is said and done.

Because of the pandemic, I spent the better part of 2 years at home. First year is too far away for me to recall. Most of my time in college has been spent surrounded by the same set of people. The physical proximity of everyone was mostly a boon in times of crisis or to keep me company during the near-daily walk to CCD or Ravindra canteen. With friends, I have experienced moments of absolute calm and peace. Moments when I have actually felt that life has some hidden meaning, a meaning I do not wish to know. Moments of joy. But at times, I have also felt the need for a more personal space. The guffaws and noise become overwhelming, and I want to be alone. Looking back, I wouldn’t have been able to spend the 2 extra years of the pandemic here.

Over the years, I have learnt to overcome these sensations because the positives of a community far outweigh these moments of emotional asphyxiation. I feel many of us greatly overestimate the value of particular people in our lives. Most of my friends who graduated in 2022 often talk about being unable to make new friends and whine about the physical distance that separates them from the ones they made in college. I have never felt the need to be in constant touch with anyone. I understand the benefits of being part of a community, but I have never understood the desire to interact every day or even every week. People are very selective with whom they talk, and all of us are very judgemental. A person's interests are mostly a product of exposure they have gotten, which depends on a myriad of factors. A lot of us are unwilling to interact and give people a chance. I have never met someone who is not interesting. People talk about the existence of NPCs. None of it makes any sense to me. I am still very close to the friends I made in school, and we hardly ever talk. The people I am friends with in college and my school friends are polar opposites. I am very comfortable with both sets of people around me. There are always different shades of personalities you can talk to, and always more people you can be friends with.

I don't have a lot of qualms with Roorkee. The course structure could have been better, but what do I know? It has been designed by people who know more about Physics than I ever will. Professors have been helpful, and when they haven’t, I can’t blame them for it. My knowledge of the subject is severely limited, and I don't think I deserve half the grades I have gotten, even though my grade point is not spectacular. To think that I deserve better grades because I did better than people who are half-assing their way through courses (like me) would be highly dishonest to the sanctity of the subject, criticising the course work or the institute when half of the college graduates by studying a week before is laughable. Roorkee has given me more than I have ever deserved. It allows us to do whatever we want, and we should respect that.

## अथर्व शुक्ला, तुम्हारी औकात क्या है?

> “दिल ना-उमीद तो नहीं नाकाम ही तो है
> लम्बी है ग़म की शाम मगर शाम ही तो है”

Life is a series of failures. An optimistic person might not concur and believe life is a series of successes. Everyone would agree that life is a series of events. Most days bleed into the next, a series of normal days where nothing of note occurs saved by a few assignment submissions or tests. This is what college is in a nutshell. You might deem it a series of events, failures, successes, and days that fill the nothingness. I see life as a series of failures, events in which I fail to perform as well as I should have. These events are interspersed by periods of hope before the next failure.

To explain this overtly pessimistic view of things is difficult. It's irrational and absurd. I will try. I don't think I have ever been unlucky. I don’t think the world has conspired against me to put me down.
On the contrary, I don’t deserve much of what I have. I am very lucky and devoid of any motivation to slog each day. I often use the meaninglessness of it all as a shield, not to work as hard as I should. Since my first year, I have been in awe of people's work to get to Roorkee. Rooms were allotted based on JEE ranks, which was further harrowing, given that my rank range was mediocre. This is amplified by the undercurrents that always exist in Roorkee. People want to be better than others. In this sense, Roorkee has been tiring. A lot of these feelings might be projections of my insecurities.

I have still survived college, and this has mostly been down to my sincerity. It stems from the realisation of my luck. To squander an opportunity served to you is being ungrateful. I have always tried to do the bare minimum to earn respect, not by the prowess of my intellect but by my consistency in being the bare minimum over a long period of time. To aim, you have to think of yourself as being competent. I have always aimed not to disappoint the people in my life.

I have dreamed of aiming high, but realistically I have never put an earnest effort towards it. I wouldn't have fared any better, even if I did. All of this has led to a vicious cycle of self-hate. I often inadvertently put myself down in conversations and thoughts. At times I sense the toxicity, but I am unable to help it. My first reaction towards my work is that of hate. I firmly believe that none of what I do deserves praise. I am at the lowest rung of the intellectual ladder, the bare minimum I could have been given the concoction of luxuries I lucked into. It is so tiring that I have almost entirely moved away from discussing academics, career, or physics. I am so tired. Each discussion tells me more about the things I do not know, the things I have forgotten, and the things I do not understand. A lot of people have a lot of plans and are very ambitious. Talking to them is a chore. I prefer talking about daily trifles and slander, stupid jokes. I don’t think there is any end to this. I can never be proud of myself. This poses a problem because in pulling myself down, I drag along the people associated with me through the object of my contempt. Something which I should have no right to do.

In “The Fall”, Albert Camus talks about demeaning and deriding oneself as a ritual to be lofted up in the sky, growing taller than those around one and looking down in contempt. To pity their happiness, to have the right to judge them because he has overwhelmed himself with disdain. Being given the right to judge everyone. I don’t think this is true, but the discussion would be incomplete without acknowledging this possibility.

I don’t find a reason to do anything at all. It is imperative to have “drive” in life. Nothing around me motivates me to do more than I already do. The clock keeps ticking; people knock on my door, sit for a while and leave. I eat my lunch, attend a few classes, and do some work. I sit idly, birds chirp, dogs bark, and the sun sets. A group passes by, gadding about, laughing, and living. The transience and triviality of human life are nauseating. I desire to desire, to aspire, to live.
I try to want things because pursuit is lively, blips on an otherwise flat line. It keeps me busy, leaving less time for thoughts to creep in. The pursuit of rolling the boulder to the top. The pursuit of wanting to pursue.

College has been bursts of energy, months at a time, during which I had a new obsession. This changed once I achieved the smallest target or completed the first project that I had started. I don’t have patience. The more time you spend with something, the more its flaws and monotony are highlighted.
I have tried to test my assumptions; maybe I am not as bad as I suppose myself to be. The pursuit of a sense of victory was to be a culmination of sincere effort leading to an eventual moment of euphoria, a feeling I have long forgotten. In hindsight, all of it was farcical. I am chasing the unattainable. I want to be the best but think too much and have too many conscientious scruples. I was sincere and worked hard to the best of my standards. To find faults would be to fall back into the abyss I am trying to creep out of. I felt joy in the process. Everyone finds joy in pursuit. I leased out all the space I had in my mind.
I failed—another knock on the door of unhappiness.

## शर्म, दहशत, झिझक, परेशानी

> “I wanted to proclaim my adoration for you by shouting it from rooftops or if sanity consumed me in person. Texting is for maidenless young men devoid of a romantic bone in their body.”

A lot of girls have a lot of girl in them, at times too much so. They are sensitive, and they care. Unlike men, there is more to them than drinking, cursing, laughing and being laughed at. More to them than liking a sport, more to them than writing code, more to them than their vocation. They have depth to them, depth that swallows you. They are the only thing you want. They are the only thing you think of. There are so many of them amongst unkempt, raucous boys. Sweet kisses to humankind. They walk with grace, laugh lightly and look at you, peering into your being, seeking out your imperfections. But they don't point them out. They listen poised, attentive, as if you are the only thing that matters. Many great men have sought refuge in women and lost their way. It's hard to fault them. They take the mind off the incessant suffering, numb the senses. We are fortunate to have them amongst us. A society of men would cease to exist, perish devoid of the melody that women hum into existence. The only problem is they are too pretty, and there are too many of them.

The ideal form of love happens, but once in a lifetime, striving for anything else is irrelevant. It has to be insanity, a thought that never leaves you until it creeps under your fingernails, fills your nostrils. Love is wishing to be perfect for someone, failing and hating yourself for it. It is a chance meeting, an intertwining of souls—bells, music, stolen glances etc. Love is an escape from the incessant pangs of pain that clutch your heart. Everything else is a stopgap, a lie, a way to survive, futile attempts to belong. To actively seek someone out is an admittance of not being interesting enough to entertain yourself or being uncomfortable in solitude. Love has to be a momentous occasion; seeking it out is trivialising it.

We betray ourselves in vain and stray away from what is the only escape from the suffering that pervades every inch of our being. We look for not love but marriages of convenience and proximity. Our conversations are driven by predisposition-daily trifles, vanity, and vehement dialogues of supposed affection which often garb the discomfort and insecurity in our own person. In most romantic relationships, the most important artefact is not the person but time. And sadly, we don’t control time. This means successes and failures hinge on something completely random. In this case, what’s the point?

Entrusting my happiness to someone else is a revolting thought. It is difficult, near impossible, to explain my thoughts, much of which I have not been able to catalogue myself and to have the patience to hear someone else out. “Knowing a person does not mean much. People change. A person may like pineapple today and something else tomorrow”. But I know myself much better than I will ever know anyone else, and I keep craving pineapples. I don’t wish to share my personal space, which I relish, with someone else. I do not want to impede someone’s individuality because of my emotional vulnerabilities. The impermanence of life is highlighted starkly in relationships not bound by blood. Ideally, I should embrace this suffering, but the warm embrace quickly becomes a strangling grip of someone I can never fully trust or understand. It doesn’t make sense. Love is embarrassing. It is suffering. For most parts, it is mental torture. It is an endless pursuit of acceptance, of being good enough. It is a series of charades, carefully chosen words and nights filled with anguish. It is all-consuming. It is suffering wrapped up in a warm blanket, a source of the eternal companion given to us in doses of sweet nothings.

## Chasing Happiness

> गुदे हुए उन रास्तों में अश्क बहते जाते है।

**Four hours of work, meal, sleep**

Prosaic tedium, the mechanical drudgery of everyday life, the clattering of my fingers on the keyboard. Everything changes yet remains the same. The same humans bridled by the same wants, fits of anger and desires of passion. The same people talking about the same things, haughty, self-important, filled with vanity. The same desires and ambitions, ignorance of the transience of human life. I do not know of the great sin we must repent by living on. The toughest thing is to carry on. It's tiring. I have to find escapes from this monotony. Goals that don't mean anything and dreams that give me respite only when shattered, never when fulfilled. Suffering drives my existence. Pursuit lightens the burden of the boulder. To find joy in this suffering is all that is left.

When I entered college, I was obsessed a great deal with the pursuit of happiness. A goal that I wanted to move towards and fulfil in the near future. I had and still have no idea what happiness constitutes. But it is always very chic to pursue it instead of pursuing money or success, which have the pitfall of being common ambitions. But the more I tried to be happy, the more elusive happiness proved to be. The state of being happy has to have its roots in finding meaning, and the more I live, the more I recognise the illusion of satisfaction and meaning. The endless run of a hamster chasing a dangling fruit.

It has proved challenging to preserve objectivity and easy for the anguish of the lack of meaning to take over. The weariness of the continual search for meaning, the turning of gears. The faceless dark emotion of despair that stares right back at you, encountered at every nook and crevice, every turn of the road. This constant peering into your soul and that of the universe is an exercise in futility. But to live with a lack of meaning is an uneasy thought. A thought that has given birth to the question of suicide, which is important because it underlines all of existence, a question I feel everyone should try to answer.

## Epictetus and Aurelius

> “इशरत-ए-क़तरा है दरिया में फ़ना हो जाना
> दर्द का हदसे गुज़रना है दवा हो जाना”

If all of life is suffering, why shouldn’t I do away with it? But what is suffering? Buddha says, “Birth is suffering; ageing is suffering; sickness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow and lamentation, pain, grief and despair are suffering; association with unpleasant is suffering; dissociation from the pleasant is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering”.
To embrace the waiting arms of eventual sleep makes no sense if the driving force is to escape suffering. Life is absurd. At times it feels like it has a mind of its own. Logical conclusions hardly follow reasoning. Events happen at random. Joy and suffering are distributed indiscriminately. In the midst of this absurdism that surrounds me, why should I try to escape it?

Suffering is a lot of things, but it is not a void. It is the opposite. It is not an unending abyss. It's the light at the end of the tunnel, the light of an approaching train, but light nonetheless. A feeling not foreign exists in the nights of never-ending pangs of pain, insecurity, and dissociation. Not far from a warm embrace, it engulfs you and provides you shelter. For a moment, you are not alone. Your mind is not empty. Suffering is the great companion we search for. A companion incapable of betrayal. Change, and the suffering it accompanies is the only constant. Like every other emotion I have ever experienced, I also have an affinity for pain. I don’t wish for it to amplify, and I hope it goes away. But it helps add colours to life, shades of black and grey, red and blue. My heart becomes heavy, and my breathing is laboured. But what is happiness if I can’t contrast it with these moments?
The stoic principles of indifference and acceptance have to be the ideals that I strive for.

## God is dead, but we must find him

> रामो विग्रहवान् धर्मः साधुः सत्य पराक्रमः
> राजा सर्वस्य लोकस्य देवानाम् इव वासवः

The argument against the pervasive lack of meaning is more brutal to counter. Dostoevsky takes the more conventional route of turning to faith. Raskolnikov accepts Sonya's love and her cross. This rings true with my religious upbringing. To give my life away would be to escape this curse admonished on me by someone greater, for he must exist, at least in my imagination, if not in reality. The idea drives all of our morality, without which we will further spiral into a cesspool of disgust. The existence of a god becomes imperative to drive the flock of humans and give us direction. Reasoning against the existence of a higher being is to drive myself to insanity, to the utter despondency of exasperation, a life of despair.
It is very easy to turn to God. A lot of us do in difficult times. I want someone looking out for me. This is the primary reason I feel religion should always exist, and the greatest evil a man can commit is to question someone’s faith. Religion, almost always in its purest essence, encourages you to do and be good. It preaches the consequences of your actions, your karma. With time I have started giving more importance to religion. It is a leap of faith that betrays the universe's absurd setting. It's irrational and improbable. Despite all this, god provides a haven I crave, one in which I have found solace.

In simpler terms, this is trusting blindly in something I will never know enough about. It is naivete. If the lack of meaning is a product of randomness, the presence of a higher being is too definitive to be true. It is a contradiction. Born of this contradiction is a constant state of unease. Far away from the absurd man, I yearn for clarifications and explanations. Recognising the meaninglessness is easy, but looking in the eyes of God and telling him he does not exist, living with this revolt is not.

I am all but 23, but life already feels like a meal I do not have enough appetite for. But the food is too tasty for me to get up and leave. 16-year-old Atharva would have vomited seeing me work a job. I feel it's progress that I could grow and let go of something that was my whole personality. College has been a journey which has mostly felt pointless. It doesn’t solve or answer anything. I still have no idea what I would like to do. I hope I am not working a job at 25, but again this thought is immature. I leave Roorkee pretty much the same as I entered, confused, besotted and with dreams of a career in Physics (?)

मेरे परिवेश की इस कोलाहलता के बीच भीतर की स्थिरता स्थायी है। इस जनसमूह में मेरी आँखें अनैच्छिक सदैव ही उसकी तलाश में रहती है।
उसकी दृष्टि के दर्शन से उत्पन्न भावना के विपरीत मैं प्रेम की किसी भी परिभाषा स्वीकार करने के लिए तैयार नही। मेरी कल्पना जैसे सजीव , परिपूर्ण आकृति प्राप्त कर सामने खड़ी हो। कुछ समय के लिए वैराग्य का स्पष्ट ज्ञान मेरे मन से ओझल मालूम होता है। ज़िन्दगी और प्रेम की नश्वरता के ख्याल कुछ समय के लिए मुझे अकेला छोड़ चले है। ज़िन्दगी का सार व इस यंत्रण से निवृति का रास्ता उससे हो कर गुज़रेगा यह मुझे स्पष्ट हो रहा है, जैसे इस रास्ते को खुद श्री राम ने प्रकाशित करा हो। उसके मास्क के पीछे से छलकती हंसी मुझे सम्मोहित कर अपनी तरफ बुलाती है।
उगते सूरज की लालिमा रात्रि के अभेद अंधकार और मौन को ललकार रही है। अंतर्मन में इस परिमित राह और समय के अनंत हो जाने की इच्छा है। इस भाव को व्यक्त करने के लिए यह मुखरा भाषा व्यर्थ है। प्रतीत होता है इस जीवन की विफलता और निरर्थकता ही उसका सौंदर्य है और मन में उत्पन्न वर्तमान भाव की सरल व्याकुलता इसकी सार्थकता का प्रत्यक्ष प्रमाण।
