## Contents

### Layouts

* `default.html`: The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their contents into this file at the line that says `{{ content }}` and are linked to this file via FrontMatter declaration `layout: default`.
* `page.html`: The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts.
* `post.html`: The layout for your posts.
* `redirect.html`: The layout for redirections, which redirects following the FrontMatter `redirect_to`.

### Includes

* `disqus.html`: Code to markup disqus comment box.
* `footer.html`: Defines the site's footer section.
* `google_analytics.html`: Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
* `head.html`: Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in _default_ layout.
* `header.html`: Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.

### Sass

* `style.scss`: Defines the variable defaults for the theme and also further imports sass partials to supplement itself.
* `_main.scss`: Defines the base styles for various HTML elements.
* `_archive.scss`: Defines the styles for archive list.
* `_article.scss`: Defines the styles for articles.
* `_code-highlight.scss`: Defines the styles for syntax-highlighting.
* `_footer.scss`: Defines the styles for footer.
* `_menu.scss`: Defines the styles for header(menu).
* `_page.scss`: Defines the styles for page.
* `_things.scss`: Defines the styles for project list.

### Assets

This directory includes sufficient css, js, and images used for the theme.

## Usage

### FrontMatter Variables

* `disable_syntax_highlight`: Default to `false`. By setting `true`, `highlight.js` will not be loaded or initiated. Recommended for non-code pages.
* `jquery`: Default to `false`. By setting `true`, `jQuery` will be loaded.

### Menu

Header menu can be customized. Add *original* file (not target file) path to `site.menu`.

```
  menu:
    - my_md_page.md
    - my_html_page.html
```

### Contact Icons

Contact icons can be set in `site.contact`. To add more contact icons, attach new items with `link` and `icon` to your target position.

```
  contact:
    - link: https://crispgm.github.io/minimal/
      icon: fa-globe
```

### Project

Project page is a place to show the information sheet of your projects. You may use `_data` file to organize the page, or even use `github-metadata` to do that.

### Disqus

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

To enable it, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  disqus:
    shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466208).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

### Google Analytics

To enable Google Anaytics, add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
  google_analytics: UA-NNNNNNNN-N
```

Google Analytics will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`
